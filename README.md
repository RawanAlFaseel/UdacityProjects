In my educational journey with Udacity in the course Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI, I completed three projects

- Seven Sages Tea Company: Developed a Power BI model to analyze sales and profitability, helping the CFO with important decisions
- Waggle Pet Device: Created a Power BI report comparing field test data for the Lapcat and Lapdog devices, focusing on customer satisfaction and demographics.
- National Clothing Chain: Made a market analysis report to improve targeted marketing and reconnect with lost customers.
